It creates a python app, in these cloud platforms, that adds two given values.

It also includes a Github Actions workflow to install list, test and format the code. Upon conclusion, it refreshes the execution success badge on top.

A Django frame is used to generate a simple form view to input integer values and display the add result.

## Notes:

Required local modifications in settings.py are in included folders for each cloud provider.

    AWS & Azure: ALLOWED_HOSTS is set to include the value of the CNAME/WEBSITE_HOSTNAME environment variable, if present. Cloud providers automatically sets this environment variable upon deployment to the app's URL.

    AWS & Azure: The DATABASES object is commented out (using """) so that the app doesn't attempt to use a database at all. To use a database, remove the comments and modify the values as appropriate for your database.
    
    Gcloud: App Engine by default looks for a main.py file at the root of the app directory with a WSGI-compatible object called app. To acomodate this, the file main.py, in the root of the gcloud django project, references the aplication as app.
